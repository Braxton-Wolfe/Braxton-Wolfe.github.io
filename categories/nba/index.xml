      <description>&lt;p&gt;Victor Wembanyama was regarded as the best prospect to enter the NBA since Lebron James over two decades ago. A primary reason for this was his elite two way ability, specifically his ability to impact the defensive side of the ball at a level we do not see in the NBA today.

We are going to dive into the data on back to backs in the NBA and see how they affect teams play, while comparing it to their other performances with rest involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

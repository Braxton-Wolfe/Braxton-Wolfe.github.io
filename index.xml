      <description>&lt;p&gt;Victor Wembanyama was regarded as the best prospect to enter the NBA since Lebron James over two decades ago. A primary reason for this was his elite two way ability, specifically his ability to impact the defensive side of the ball at a level we do not see in the NBA today. While a lot of that defensive hype he has gotten is because of his extraordinary size, there are plenty of other key factors and areas that Wembanyama thrives in to make his impact felt so much on the basketball court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
